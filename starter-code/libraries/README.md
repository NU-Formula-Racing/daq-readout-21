# Welcome to libraries! Here's all the libraries you need to download:
# - the Spark CAN library, slightly modified to work for Arduino Mega and our specific pin layout
# - our custom CAN library, with more commands to simplify other code
# - ADAFruit 1X15 - you need version 1.1. Get it from here, or here's the link:
# - I2C - here's the link. STill figuring out if this is exactly what we want.
# - Nothing else for now, but it's worth noting that we're also using standard SD card and serial libraries from Arduino.
